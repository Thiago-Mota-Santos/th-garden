As we walk the road of life, obstacles stand in our way. They are like a guest in our home, a brother who will never leave our side. And just as we fear hurting our brother, we fear the obstacle leaving us—it reaches a point where it feels comfortable. "It is easier to be mediocre than to be excellent."

It’s like a red light—you never remember which foot was the first to move, whether it was the left or the right. Yet, they are there. Such are obstacles, such is the "gap." Sometimes we overcome one, only for ten more to appear.

And sometimes, it’s the excitement, the fear, that keeps us stuck. There is the other side, but you only catch glimpses of it.

You must be unstoppable.

You must be extraordinary.

Let your actions unsettle others.

Move forward to the next stage.

The journey is singular.

A journey of a thousand miles was still a one-way road.
