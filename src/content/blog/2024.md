*2024*

This year i work a lot;

This year i learn a lot;

This year i realized that I still have a long way to go;

This year I was disappointed in people, there are only children;

This year I saw great people trying to change, help each other in a beautiful way.

This year i see the gap;

This year was amazing;

This year I saw human suffering and misery up close;

This year I saw the thread of destiny and the hand of God acting;

This year I missed you, I thought, will we talk again in this starry sky?

This year I gave in;

This year I sinned;

This year I cried;

This year I loved it;

This year I traveled;

That year I had a dream;

This year I walked a path that is still a one-way street.
